# Python_Full_Project_using_MNIST_dataset

Task-1:
In the provided code, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is configured and trained on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit classification using TensorFlow and Keras. Let's discuss the configuration and training options chosen in the code:

Data Preprocessing:

The MNIST dataset is loaded and split into training and testing sets.
The pixel values of the images are normalized to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.
The labels are one-hot encoded using tf.keras.utils.to_categorical to convert them into a binary matrix representation.
Model Architecture:

The model is a sequential neural network with convolutional and dense layers.
Convolutional layers:
The first convolutional layer (Conv2D) has 32 filters, a 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation, and the input shape is set to (28, 28, 1).
The second convolutional layer has 64 filters and a 3x3 kernel, followed by max-pooling (MaxPooling2D).
The third convolutional layer has 128 filters and a 3x3 kernel, followed by max-pooling.
Flatten layer is used to flatten the output from convolutional layers.
Dense layers:
A fully connected dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation.
A dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.5 for regularization.
The final output layer with 10 units (number of classes for digits) and softmax activation.
Regularization:

Regularization is applied to the convolutional layers using kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.001). L2 regularization helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights in the network.
Model Compilation:

The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, categorical crossentropy loss, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.
Training:

The model is trained using the fit method on the training data for 15 epochs with a batch size of 64.
The validation data is specified to monitor the model's performance on unseen data during training.
Evaluation:

After training, the model is evaluated on the test set using the evaluate method.
The test accuracy and loss are printed to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
Choices and Rationale:

Architecture: The chosen architecture follows a common pattern for image classification tasks with convolutional layers followed by dense layers. This architecture is suitable for capturing hierarchical features in images.
Regularization: L2 regularization is applied to the convolutional layers to prevent overfitting, especially given the relatively small size of the dataset.
Activation Functions: ReLU activation is used for convolutional and dense layers, which is a common choice for promoting non-linearity in neural networks.
Optimizer: The Adam optimizer is chosen for its adaptive learning rate properties, which often leads to faster convergence.
Loss Function: Categorical crossentropy is chosen as the loss function for multi-class classification tasks.
These choices aim to create a model that generalizes well to unseen data while avoiding overfitting through regularization. The configuration follows best practices for CNNs in image classification tasks.


Task-2:
In the provided Python code, a SQLite database is created and manipulated using the SQLite3 library. Let's discuss how the database is organized and the reasoning behind the chosen structure:

Database Connection:

The code connects to an SQLite database named 'my_database.db' using sqlite3.connect(). If the database does not exist, it will be created.
Table Structure:

A table named 'users' is created using the CREATE TABLE SQL statement.
The table has three columns:
'id': An INTEGER column representing the user's unique identifier (Primary Key).
'name': A TEXT column representing the user's name (NOT NULL).
'age': An INTEGER column representing the user's age.
Functions for Data Manipulation:

The code defines several functions to manipulate data in the 'users' table:
add_user(name, age): Inserts a new user into the table with the provided name and age.
retrieve_users(): Retrieves all users from the table and prints the results.
update_user_age(name, new_age): Updates the age of a user with the specified name.
delete_user(name): Deletes a user with the specified name from the table.
Example Usage:

The code demonstrates the usage of these functions:
Adds two users ('John Doe' and 'Jane Smith') to the table.
Retrieves and prints all users before and after updating 'John Doe's age.
Deletes 'Jane Smith' from the table.
Finally, it closes the database connection.
Primary Key and Indexing:

The 'id' column is designated as the primary key, ensuring each user has a unique identifier.
While indexing is not explicitly specified in this example, SQLite automatically creates an index for the primary key, improving query performance.
Reasoning for the Structure:

Normalization: The structure follows basic normalization principles by separating user information into a 'users' table with distinct columns for 'name' and 'age'.
Primary Key: The 'id' column serves as the primary key, providing a unique identifier for each user and facilitating efficient data retrieval.
Data Integrity: The 'name' column is marked as NOT NULL to ensure data integrity by preventing the insertion of users with missing names.
Simplicity: The structure is kept simple for illustrative purposes, but it can be extended based on specific application requirements.
Overall, the chosen structure provides a foundation for managing user data with simplicity, normalization, and data integrity considerations. It allows for efficient retrieval, updating, and deletion of user records.

Task-3:
The provided code is organized into a Python script that interacts with the Google Sheets API to fetch data from a specified range in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. Let's discuss the organization of the code and the chosen data processing approaches:

Code Structure:

The code is organized into a script structure with import statements at the beginning, followed by the definition of functions and an example usage section.
It uses the google-auth and googleapiclient libraries for authentication and interacting with the Google Sheets API.
Authentication:

The code authenticates with the Google Sheets API using the google.auth.default() method to obtain credentials.
The authentication details are used to build the Google Sheets API service client.
Functions:

The get_google_sheets_data function takes a spreadsheet_id and range_name as parameters and makes a request to the Google Sheets API to fetch data from the specified range.
The process_sheets_data function processes the raw data received from the API response. In this example, it extracts values from the response.
Error Handling:

The code includes error handling using a try and except block around the API call. If an exception occurs, it prints an error message, and the function returns None.
Debugging Information:

Debugging information is included by printing the request object before making the API call. This helps in understanding the structure of the API request being sent.
Example Usage:

The script provides an example of using the functions to fetch data from a Google Sheets spreadsheet. It includes placeholder values for the spreadsheet_id and range_name which the user should replace with actual values.
Data Processing Approach:

The data processing approach involves fetching raw data from the Google Sheets API and then processing it in the process_sheets_data function.
In this example, the processing is simple and involves extracting values from the response. Depending on the specific use case, more complex processing steps could be added.
Overall, the code is organized in a modular and readable manner. It separates concerns by encapsulating functionality into functions, includes error handling for robustness, and provides a clear example of how to use the Google Sheets API to fetch and process data. The chosen data processing approach is minimal in this example, but it can be expanded based on the requirements of the specific use case.
